				<h2>Week 1</h2>

				<!-- Exercise 1.1 Start -->
				<p>Exercise 1.1
					<br>The approach for the first section of lab 1 exercise is to try to create something simple of a house and with people to decorate the environment. The reason for such is that as a kid, whenever I learn how to draw or make something, I always start with this basic concept, and since I am learning a new software, I wanted to translate that idea.

				<!-- Exercise 1.1 End -->

				<!-- Exercise 1.2 Start -->
				<p>Exercise 1.2
					<br>In the second exercise, I wanted to create a head sculpture that was abstract in terms of shape which seems to add a bit of movement when the audience looks at it.  However, I kept the model to be rather simple during this exploration and learning stage since the higher level techniques have not been learned yet.

				<!-- Exercise 1.2 End -->

				<!-- Exercise 1.3 Start -->
				<p>Exercise 1.3
					<br>With the inspiration of the feature animation film of Frozen from Disney Pixar, I wanted to create a pattern of snowflakes.  Furthermore, because of the exercise in making a pattern, I wanted to see how a flat plane will render out if for my team project we decide to model some 2D elements for a 2D world that we have.

				<h2>Week 2</h2>
				
				<!-- Exercise 2.1 Start -->
				<p>Exercise 2.1
					<br>For this exercise, I wanted to recreate the balance figure of a human character as what it will look like if they were trying to balance on a moving cart.

				<!-- Exercise 2.1 End -->

				<!-- Exercise 2.2 Start -->
				<p>Exercise 2.2
					<br>In the images below, the approach that I went for is to show that the doll figure is really small inside the drawer and how it wants to leave, but then there is a large girl present.  With this scene, I also wanted to translate the idea from Toys Story.

				<!-- Exercise 2.2 End -->

				<!-- Exercise 2.3 Start -->
				<p>Exercise 2.3
					<br>As for the environment modelling exercise, the approach that I went with is to create a castle wall that protects people inside and that because it is isolated on a piece of land surrounded by a river, a bridge was build. The first shot is to show the entire layout of the land and the second shot shows a close up to represent the perspective of someone walking on the bridge.

				<h2>Week 3</h2>

				<!-- Exercise 3.1 Start -->
				<p>Exercise 3.1
					<br>In this exercise, I wanted to create cookie cutters that can potentially make cookies that refers to night time, hence the star cutter and the moon cutter that is placed on a plate.

				<!-- Exercise 3.1 End -->

				<!-- Exercise 3.2 Start -->
				<p>Exercise 3.2
					<br>For this beer mug learned from the tutorial, I wanted to explore the camera angles to give a sense of change in perception of how it will look like at a normal distance and how it will be a different contrast when it is extremely zoomed in.

				<!-- Exercise 3.2 End -->

				<!-- Exercise 3.3 Start -->
				<p>Exercise 3.3
					<br>To practice more on manipulating curves for the NURBS curve tools, I decided to make a wine glass and bottle since it will be two of the type of objects needed in my team project animation.
