				<h2>Week 1</h2>

				<!-- Exercise 1.1 Start -->
				<p>Exercise 1.1
					<br>The approach for the first section of lab 1 exercise is to try to create something simple of a house and with people to decorate the environment. The reason for such is that as a kid, whenever I learn how to draw or make something, I always start with this basic concept, and since I am learning a new software, I wanted to translate that idea.

				<!-- Exercise 1.1 End -->

				<!-- Exercise 1.2 Start -->
				<p>Exercise 1.2
					<br>In the second exercise, I wanted to create a head sculpture that was abstract in terms of shape which seems to add a bit of movement when the audience looks at it.  However, I kept the model to be rather simple during this exploration and learning stage since the higher level techniques have not been learned yet.

				<!-- Exercise 1.2 End -->

				<!-- Exercise 1.3 Start -->
				<p>Exercise 1.3
					<br>With the inspiration of the feature animation film of Frozen from Disney Pixar, I wanted to create a pattern of snowflakes.  Furthermore, because of the exercise in making a pattern, I wanted to see how a flat plane will render out if for my team project we decide to model some 2D elements for a 2D world that we have.

				<h2>Week 2</h2>
				
				<!-- Exercise 2.1 Start -->
				<p>Exercise 2.1
					<br>For this exercise, I wanted to recreate the balance figure of a human character as what it will look like if they were trying to balance on a moving cart.

				<!-- Exercise 2.1 End -->

				<!-- Exercise 2.2 Start -->
				<p>Exercise 2.2
					<br>In the images below, the approach that I went for is to show that the doll figure is really small inside the drawer and how it wants to leave, but then there is a large girl present.  With this scene, I also wanted to translate the idea from Toys Story.

				<!-- Exercise 2.2 End -->

				<!-- Exercise 2.3 Start -->
				<p>Exercise 2.3
					<br>As for the environment modelling exercise, the approach that I went with is to create a castle wall that protects people inside and that because it is isolated on a piece of land surrounded by a river, a bridge was build. The first shot is to show the entire layout of the land and the second shot shows a close up to represent the perspective of someone walking on the bridge.

				<h2>Week 3</h2>

				<!-- Exercise 3.1 Start -->
				<p>Exercise 3.1
					<br>In this exercise, I wanted to create cookie cutters that can potentially make cookies that refers to night time, hence the star cutter and the moon cutter that is placed on a plate.

				<!-- Exercise 3.2 Start -->
				<p>Exercise 3.2
					<br>For this beer mug learned from the tutorial, I wanted to explore the camera angles to give a sense of change in perception of how it will look like at a normal distance and how it will be a different contrast when it is extremely zoomed in.

				<!-- Exercise 3.3 Start -->
				<p>Exercise 3.3
					<br>To practice more on manipulating curves for the NURBS curve tools, I decided to make a wine glass and bottle since it will be two of the type of objects needed in my team project animation.

				<h2>Week 4</h2>

				<!-- Exercise 4 Start -->
				<p>Exercise 4
					<br>For the first camera angle, it was necessary to put it as the first person perspective, on top of the Agent's head.  And so, I rotated the camera angle, as well as adjust it's position to sit properly on top of the Agent's head to make the first POV more realistic.  For instance, in the clip shown below, what the audience see, should be what the Agent see which is at a low angle and can see minimal of mostly the floor since Agent is on a sled, which the Agent is attached to a motion path on the ground. Furthermore, I also applied colour and texture on the house and ball.

				<!-- Exercise 5.1 Start -->
				<p>Exercise 5.1
					<br>In order to learn texture and bump mapping, here are two image rendered out where in the first image, it is simply a trial in checkered texture, playing with two different colour while the second image is a close up to show the subtle bump map texture used.

				<!-- Exercise 5.1 End -->

				<!-- Exercise 5.2 Start -->
				<p>Exercise 5.2 
					<br>For this exercise, I learned how to use texture mapping by rotating and shifting around the image on the table using the UV Editor to get the correct placement. With the camera angle used, the slight tilt can offer a minor perspective of the distortion given to the mapped table.

				<!-- Exercise 5.3 Start -->
				<p>Exercise 5.3
					<br>In the two renders below, there are various types of lighting used in order to give the scene a dramatic, yet beautiful look. To do so, I first adjusted the colour, intensity and decay of the spot light, along by adding a tint of fog. Next, I added an image map to the light which gives the starlight effect. Lastly, a lens flare has been added for the dramatic effect.  Also, refraction and reflection has been added to the figure and half ball next to it to create a realistic effect.
