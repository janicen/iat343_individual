				<h2>Week 1</h2>

				<!-- Exercise 1.1 Start -->
				<p>Exercise 1.1
					<br>The approach for the first section of lab 1 exercise is to try to create something simple of a house and with people to decorate the environment. The reason for such is that as a kid, whenever I learn how to draw or make something, I always start with this basic concept, and since I am learning a new software, I wanted to translate that idea.

				<!-- Exercise 1.1 End -->

				<!-- Exercise 1.2 Start -->
				<p>Exercise 1.2
					<br>In the second exercise, I wanted to create a head sculpture that was abstract in terms of shape which seems to add a bit of movement when the audience looks at it.  However, I kept the model to be rather simple during this exploration and learning stage since the higher level techniques have not been learned yet.

				<!-- Exercise 1.3 Start -->
				<p>Exercise 1.3
					<br>With the inspiration of the feature animation film of Frozen from Disney Pixar, I wanted to create a pattern of snowflakes.  Furthermore, because of the exercise in making a pattern, I wanted to see how a flat plane will render out if for my team project we decide to model some 2D elements for a 2D world that we have.

				<p>Exercise 2.3
					<br>As for the environment modelling exercise, the approach that I went with is to create a castle wall that protects people inside and that because it is isolated on a piece of land surrounded by a river, a bridge was build. The first shot is to show the entire layout of the land and the second shot shows a close up to represent the perspective of someone walking on the bridge.

				<h2>Week 4</h2>

				<!-- Exercise 4 Start -->
				<p>Exercise 4
					<br>The screenshot below represents 4 different camera viewports of various camera angles implemented.  Also, the mix preview displays how camera 1 is in the wireframe mode, camera 2 is in the flat shading mode, camera 3 is when its textured and that the perspective view is at its default state.  However, while camera 1 is set to flat shading which simply shows colours, the placement of camera 3 has not been set on a space that has textured elements, but the textured portion of the ball object can be seen in the other images below where a blue and fractal texture has been applied to the ball.
				</p>

					<img src="./img/Ng_JN_4_1_camerasscreens.png" width="900" height="400" alt="image1"/>

				<p>
					<br>For the first camera angle, it was necessary to put it as the first person perspective, on top of the Agent's head.  And so, I rotated the camera angle, as well as adjust it's position to sit properly on top of the Agent's head to make the first POV more realistic.  For instance, in the visuals shown below, what the audience see, should be what the Agent see which is at a low angle and can see minimal of mostly the floor since Agent is on a sled, which the Agent is attached to a motion path on the ground. Furthermore, I also applied colour and texture on the house and ball.

				<p>
					<br>As for camera 2, the intend is to place the camera far back which serves as a long shot that tracks the movement of the Agent from a birds-eye-view.  Additionally, this shot is taken from a frame into the scene which provides the entire picture of the environmental and character events.

				<p>Exercise 5.2 
					<br>For this exercise, I learned how to use texture mapping by rotating and shifting around the image on the table using the UV Editor to get the correct placement. With the camera angle used, the slight tilt can offer a minor perspective of the distortion given to the mapped table.

				<p>Exercise 5.3
					<br>In the two renders below, there are various types of lighting used in order to give the scene a dramatic, yet beautiful look. To do so, I first adjusted the colour, intensity and decay of the spot light, along by adding a tint of fog. Next, I added an image map to the light which gives the starlight effect. Lastly, a lens flare has been added for the dramatic effect.  Also, refraction and reflection has been added to the figure and half ball next to it to create a realistic effect.

To do so, I first created a box of the basic fish shape, followed by gradually extruding the box to create the tail and fins. Eventually, I adjusted the curves by pulling and stretching vertices, faces and edges to create the final form.

				<p>Exercise 7.2 
					<br>In this exercise which explores a technique of doing texture mapping, I brought up Adobe Photoshop and tried to paint texture using the UV map exported from Maya. Afterwards, I updated the texture map which then updated my new texture. As seen in the first image below, I used the UV texture editor to manipulate and understand my drawn texture and to map it on the object's surface to execute the result of the two renders below. I am not too proficient in drawing, but I tried to create a fun, candy looking house as my approach for this section of the exercise.

As for the second image, I wanted to get the figure in focus in a natural sense, so I zoomed in and used a normal 50 focal length and a larger aperture.

Furthermore, the 3 animatic principals applied to the second video consists of Squash and Stretch (a point when it hits the ground), Slow-In and Slow-Out (beginning and ending), as well as Secondary Action (falling at the end).
